## Neural Network Study
The readme `md` is [here](./Neural_Network_Study/Study_NeuralNet.md).
- Dataset for classification problem is given, and design classifier using perceptron layer.
- Please check the markdown and `c++` and `python` codes for understanding works.

## The Basic Tensorflow Lab

The notebook has 3 problems for you to solve:
 - Problem 1: Normalize the features
 - Problem 2: Use TensorFlow operations to create features, labels, weight, and biases tensors
 - Problem 3: Tune the learning rate, number of steps, and batch size for the best accuracy

This is a self-assessed lab.  Compare your answers to the solutions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab/blob/master/solutions.ipynb)
